# IMDB Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction ##
This project focuses on building and evaluating neural netwrok model for sentimental analysis. The model architecture incorporates the following layers embedding layer, linear layer, ReLu, dropout layer andbatchnorm layer.

# Model Training
Model Training involves five steps:

Step 1: Compute model's predictions - forward pass (both train and eval)
Step 2: Compute loss (both train and eval)
Step 3: Compute the gradients (only train)
Step 4: Update the parameters (only train)
Step 5: Repeat steps 1 - 4
